# Simple Piano
## About the author
Miguel Herrera √Ålvarez. Last-year Computer Engineering student in the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.

## Develop
In this project I learn how to create sound in Processing. I have created a piano that will reproduce the respective note you touch with the keys using and oscilator with the MIDI frequencies and an env.

WARNING: I do not recomend to hold a key or pressed more than one at the same time due to you will hear a loud sound.

## Decisions
I tried to emulate the piano distribution with the keyboard so the controls are:
- S for Do(C in alphabetic system)
- D for Re(D)
- F for Mi(E)
- G for Fa(F)
- H for Sol(G)
- J for La(A)
- K for Si(B)
- E for Do#(C#)
- R for Re#(D#)
- Y for Fa#(F#)
- U for Sol#(G#)
- I for La#(H#)

## Tools and references
- [Processing 3.5.4](http://processing.org/)
